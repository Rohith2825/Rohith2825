# Virtual Reality for People With Neurodevelopmental Disorders


People suffering from Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD), using it may be difficult and frustrating, as most programs are not developed with these people needs in mind. In this project, we try to address this issue by implementing an adaptive system, aware of the events taking place within it and capable of adjusting itself, thereby modulating the complexity of the gameplay. The application we're developing is an educational Android game that takes place in a VR environment, and is designed in way that aims to minimize explicit user input, relying instead on behavior analysis and gaze input tracking. A psychologist should accompany the user during gameplay to monitor his/her progress, provide assistance when needed, and analyze the results to further understand the userâ€™s conditions.
